            <p class="paragraph">
                It all started when my grandparents purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first computer
                I had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used it for games, which my grandma
                would set up for me to play. I also drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the functionality
                of which, unfortunately, was very limited. The relatively new computer industry's technology could not
                produce enough colors to portray very realistic pictures. Despite this fact, I spent many contented
                hours creating images on my grandparent's computer
                A few years later, my family moved. As we were no longer close enough to use my grandparent's computer,
                we purchased a new one for ourselves. I again used the computer for games and did some text editing, but
                started to utilize the paint program even more than I had before. The up-to-date colors available meant
                that I could create fairly high-quality pictures. However, my limited paint program again handicapped my
                skills, its inadequate tools requiring me to draw every pixel manually, which proved very time
                consuming.
                After using the new computer for a few years, I sent a picture I had created to my uncles who work with
                3D imaging. They were impressed, and asked me if I would like a professional imaging program. For my
                next birthday I received the digital imaging software Photoshop LE, renowned for its professional
                capabilities. This tool took my imaging skills to all new heights. I was able to quickly and easily
                create high-quality images, and could edit and enhance existing photos for professional-like results.
                Photoshop became by far my favorite program, and I spent much time expanding my imaging skills and
                knowledge.
